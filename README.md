HYelp
This web-based app is an ad-free personal alternative to the busy, data overloaded Yelp, Google Reviews space.  Empowering users to quickly find what they are craving for, great foodie experiences. HYelp allows users to relive great experiences through the use of favorites.

## Getting Started
To start the app, open the link https://valeriemiller5.github.io/Group-Project-1/. The app is ready to use upon page loading.  In order to save favorites, users must use the simple sign up/sign in buttons at the top of the page to create an account.

## Prerequisites
Google Chrome (PC) or Safari (Mac) is recommended for running this program.

## Running the tests
Logs have been set at various points in this program. To see test the code, use the "Inspect" command in Google Chrome (right click on the webpage), then click the "console" tab.

Notable issues when creating this program were conflicts with cross-referencing the 3 API's that were used.  Through updates, most of these conflicts have been addressed.

## Built With
* jQuery - to create the actions of the game
* CSS/Bootstrap - visuals for the webpage
* Zomato API - database used to pull JSON data for restaurant selections
* ZipCodes API - since Zomato works better by pulling city names, this API was added to be able to locate restaurants by 
* Google Maps API - used to show locations of restaurants, including markers that showed restaurant info when mouse hovers over the marker
* Firebase - used to store user information for sign up/log ins
